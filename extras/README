I've included some extras to help you deploy and monitor skynet.

init.d/skynet  # sample init.d script to start/stop/restart skynet

nagios/check_skynet.sh  # A script we use to have nagios (a monitoring tool) check our skynet Q.

rails/*  # I've included the controller and view we use to monitor our skynet Q
